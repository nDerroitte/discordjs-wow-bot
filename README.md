# Bot stuff

This is a repo about making a bot to optimise a World of Warcraft gold boosting community generating hundreds of milions of gold.  

## How it works

World of Warcraft is a game where the best equipements are rewarded to players doing the hardest content.
A lot of casual players, or advanced players creating multiple characters, don't do this hard content by their own because they lack the motivation, time or skill.

For gold, players can buy our service: a **boost**. The casual player, called the **buyer, client or boostee** , will contact one of our **advertiser**.
The advertiser will set up a group of strong players, called **boosters** to help the client obtaining the loot he seeks.
On average, each booster (there are 4 of them in a boost) get 18% of the total pot. The advertiser will also get 18%. The 10% remaining will go to the community owner which is the bot owner.

## Gold reference

200k gold in WoW is roughly 20€. At its prime, this bot helped generating about 120M+ gold per month, aka about 12.000€. 10% of that total can be counted has pure profits, the 90 other percent are redistributed to the actors of the community.

This bot runned for about 2,5 years before the community it was served on was shut down by Blizzard. It helped generating about 3 billions gold, 300M profits, which could probably be traded for about 20k€.
For legal purposes, let's obviously add that :  
*As the community has no interest in doing RMT (Real Money Transaction, aka selling real gold for €), no one actually gain € from this bot.
It just helped making a lot of people very rich in one (if not the) most popular multiplayer role-playing game.*
